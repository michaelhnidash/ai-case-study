# Zest AI

## Overview and Origin

> [Zest AI](https://www.zest.ai/) 

* A pioneer in AI lending innovation since 2009.

* **_CEO_**: Mike de Vere, 50.

  **_Cofounders_**: Former CEO Douglas Merrill, 53; former president Shawn Budde, 58.

> _**Douglas Merrill, a former Google executive, founded Zest AI in 2009 to leverage machine learning and big data analytics for enhancing credit underwriting processes, aiming to make credit more accessible and fair. The company is on a mission to make fair and transparent credit available to everyone and have grown to become a leader in inclusive underwriting software.**_

* Zest AI secures growth capital from fintech investors, strategic partners, and customers to advance the next generation of AI-automated underwriting. As of November 2022, Zest AI has raised over $50 million in a growth funding round co-led by Insight Partners and CMFG Ventures, with participation from CU Direct, Curql, Suncoast Credit Union, Golden1 Credit Union, Hawaii USA Federal Credit Union, and NorthGate Capital. This brings the company's total funding to approximately $120 million. 

## Business Activities

* Zest AI’s technology is solving this huge problem by automating consumer credit underwriting with more accurate and equitable lending insights — supporting our mission to broaden access to credit and enable financial equity for all.

* Zest AI primarily serves financial institutions, including banks, credit unions, and lending organizations, by providing AI-driven credit underwriting solutions to enhance lending decisions. A number of the most innovative lending organizations, such as Citibank, First National Bank of Omaha, Truist, Golden 1 Credit Union, Suncoast Credit Union, and Hawaii USA Federal Credit Union, have partnered with Zest AI to modernize their lending business. As of 2023, Zest AI's client base has grown to over 175 customers, up from 105 in the previous year. The global credit risk assessment market, encompassing credit underwriting software, was valued at approximately $7.31 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $18.43 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 14.1%.

### **Benefits compared to competitors:**

* _Advanced Machine Learning for Credit Underwriting:_
 Zest AI uses an end-to-end ML modeling workflow to ingest credit application data, historical repayment behavior, credit bureau attributes, and custom data sources. Their platform automates feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning to produce highly predictive risk models. These models often outperform traditional scorecards and bureau-based models by uncovering non-linear relationships and subtle interactions.

* _Fairness and Bias Mitigation:_
 Beyond accuracy, Zest AI explicitly focuses on fairness. Their platform can run assessments on protected classes, checking for disparate impact and introducing constraints that reduce bias in approvals. If certain attributes (e.g., income or zip code) inadvertently cause disproportionate outcomes, data scientists can identify and mitigate these effects during the model-building stage.

* _Compliance-Ready Workflows:_
Lending is heavily regulated. Zest AI incorporates compliance measures into the model development pipeline. Their platform ensures that model outputs and adverse action reason codes comply with regulations like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). By doing so, they mitigate the risk of biased outcomes and discriminatory lending practices, facilitating alignment with regulatory bodies and internal compliance teams.

### **They currently use the following technologies:**

* Advanced Machine Learning for Credit Underwriting.
* Interpretable and Explainable Models.
* Compliance-Ready Workflows.
* Fairness and Bias Mitigation.
* Scalability and Integration.


## Landscape

* Zest AI operates in the financial technology (fintech) field, specifically focusing on credit underwriting and risk assessment.

### **Trends and Innovations in AI and Fintech:**

 * _Focus on Fair Lending Practices:_ Regulators and consumers have pushed for more equitable lending practices. AI-driven platforms now incorporate fairness assessments to mitigate biases and ensure compliance with laws like ECOA and FCRA.

 * _Regulatory Technology (RegTech):_ Innovations in compliance technology ensure models adhere to stringent regulations, making fintech solutions more transparent and aligned with legal requirements.

 * _Expansion of Alternative Data Sources:_ Alternative credit data provides a clearer view of a consumer’s financial situation and ability to pay. Types of alternative credit data used across the credit spectrum include user-permissioned account data, cashflow transactions, rental data, property data, income data, and full-file public records, as well as data from nontraditional lenders such as single pay, rent-to-own, title loans and short-term installments.
